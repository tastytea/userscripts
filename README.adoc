= Userscripts

I collect my userscripts here. To use them you will need a userscript-manager
like https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/[Greasemonkey],
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/[Tampermonkey] or
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/[Violentmonkey].

To install a script, navigate to the file and click on the “Raw”-button at the
top right. Your userscript-manager should then ask you to install it.

Unless otherwise noted, the scripts are licensed under the
https://schlomp.space/tastytea/userscripts/src/branch/main/LICENSE[GPLv3].
